In this project I am trying to find out the most popular sold games, publishers, plateforms by sales and also to identify best selling genres on plateforms and find out genre sales by each region and to identify average of total sales, it consist data of video games sold since 1980 to 2020 with 12 fields and 16598 rows with their publishers, plateforms and genre of games on which year they were published with the sales they made in Europe, Japan, North America and other Regions.

conclusion :

> PS2 is the top grossing plateform

> Action is the top grossing genre

> Publisher ‘Nintendo’ sold the highest number of games

> Wii Sports ranks number one in terms of global across all the plateforms

> Highest sales of video games occur in the year 2008 and after 2008 video games sales has been less may be lack of interest and awareness 

> Most popular game lovers are from North America may be other Region has lack of promotion and awareness


The Next Step :
 
Publisher should be focus on those things where the video game sales are less like promotion, awareness, creativity so that video game sales has to be maintained on all over region.
